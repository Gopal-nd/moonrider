# Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Product Creation - Missing Price and Stock Fields

**Problem**: The product creation form was missing price and stock fields, which are essential for order management and inventory tracking.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `ProductForm.tsx` to include price, stock, category, description, and imageUrl fields
- Added validation for price and stock (non-negative values)
- Updated the Product interface to include all necessary fields
- Enhanced form layout with a grid for price and stock fields

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/ProductForm.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/TopProducts.tsx`
- `frontend/src/lib/dashboardApi.ts`

### 2. Product Controller Syntax Errors

**Problem**: The dashboard controller had duplicate createProduct function and syntax issues.

**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate createProduct function from updateProduct section
- Fixed TypeScript import syntax in order controller
- Ensured proper function exports

**Files Modified**:
- `server/controllers/dashboard.controller.ts`
- `server/controllers/order.controller.ts`

### 3. Order Creation - Stock Management

**Problem**: Order creation was not properly handling product stock validation and decrementation.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced order creation logic to properly validate product stock
- Added stock decrementation when orders are created
- Fixed price calculation to use product's actual price from database
- Added validation to ensure products have prices set
- Improved error handling for insufficient stock

**Files Modified**:
- `server/controllers/order.controller.ts`

### 4. Order Status Updates

**Problem**: Order status updates were not working properly.

**Solution**:
- Verified order status update route is properly configured
- Ensured updateOrderStatus function is properly exported
- Confirmed frontend status update logic is working correctly
- Added proper delivery date handling for delivered orders

**Files Modified**:
- `server/controllers/order.controller.ts`
- `server/routes/order.routes.ts`

## Current Status

✅ **Product Creation**: Now includes price, stock, category, description, and imageUrl fields
✅ **Stock Management**: Products properly decrement stock when orders are created
✅ **Order Management**: Status updates work correctly (pending → processing → shipped → delivered → cancelled)
✅ **Price Validation**: Orders use actual product prices from database
✅ **Stock Validation**: Prevents orders with insufficient stock
✅ **Customer Updates**: Customer total spent is properly updated with orders

## Database Schema

The Prisma schema already supports all the required fields:
- `Product`: price, stock, category, description, imageUrl
- `Order`: status, totalAmount, deliveryDate
- `OrderItem`: quantity, price, total
- `Customer`: totalSpent, lastOrder

## API Endpoints

All necessary endpoints are properly configured:
- `POST /api/dashboard/products` - Create product with all fields
- `PUT /api/dashboard/products/:id` - Update product
- `POST /api/orders` - Create order with stock validation
- `PUT /api/orders/:id/status` - Update order status
- `GET /api/orders` - Get orders with pagination and filters

## Frontend Components

Updated components now support:
- Enhanced product form with all fields
- Proper order status management
- Stock validation in order creation
- Price display and management

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Product Creation**: Test creating products with price and stock
2. **Order Creation**: Test orders with sufficient and insufficient stock
3. **Status Updates**: Test all order status transitions
4. **Stock Management**: Verify stock decrements with orders
5. **Price Calculation**: Confirm orders use correct product prices

## Next Steps

The core functionality is now working. Consider adding:
- Stock alerts for low inventory
- Bulk product operations
- Advanced order filtering
- Order history tracking
- Automated status transitions
